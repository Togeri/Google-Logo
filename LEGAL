Please, note that I do this for entirely personal and educational purposes only.
Trademark's rights and property belongs to Google, which I took as an EXAMPLE to REPLICATE a logo. 
I do not allow any lucrative use of this code. 
That been said: I encourage you to try it out! With Google or whatever company which logo you may like! 
Here you have my code. It won't be the more efficient or better written, but I've been coding for just 5 days.
I hope making my code public helps you figuring out how to manipulate elements in HTML or CSS. 
And remember to show off your work too! Sharing is Power! =)
